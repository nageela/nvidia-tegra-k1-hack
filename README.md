Hacking the Nvidia Shield Tegra K1 Tablet to Dualboot Android and Linux 

Itâ€™s an unusual choice of hardware but I needed a tablet built on the Nvidia Tegra K8 GPU, onto which I wanted to port an existing C++ custom application.

This tablet is end of life and I had to work through a complicated set of (old) software dependencies to get my application working.

Summary of steps taken:
1.	Flash tablet with Lollipop 5.1.1
2.	Unroot tablet
3.	Install dualboot manager  
4.	Install Linux
5.	Install dependencies for application 
6.	Make application 
7.	Sort out memory problem
